The purose of this program is to read the contents of a file and print to 
a designated file each character of the file with a > before the character
and a < after. If it's a newline character it prints a > followed by a <
on the next line using python, c, prolog, ML, postscript.

NOTE: These are not working programs, rather methods. The assignment calls
for methods, not executables.
